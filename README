
This is a project I made while studying JAVA. It is a 2D game 
where you control a lightcycle. I wasn't able to complete everything,
because I wasn't familiar with game AIs. 


So, in order to execute it, just create a new project in Eclipse.
It will be much easier with Eclipse. Then import a2_ashinkevich_source 
into a project. Open TronLightCycle.java in tron_lightcycle.package
and run it. 

If you want to run it from command line, then 
start with TronLightCycle.java, it is where the main is.
